Plasma Density Diagnostics at FLASHForward, DESY - written by Lewis Dickson - Summer project 2018

This script uses the longitudinal laser diagnostics at FLASHForward, DESY, to produce the plasma density within the plasma cell and perform
diagnostics on the laser.

Steps for use:
1) Create and define directories for the saving (or retrival of background) data. 
2) Select desired user settings in the ``user input'' section
3) Run!


##### USER SETTINGS #####
-> "example_setting" : '0' will instruct the code to gather data from the laser diagnostics, '1' will run the Gaussian laser distrobution
example whose intensities can be defined by the user on line 261. '2' will use preloaded data in a location that must be defined in
the directory section begining at line 24.
-> "hide_fig" : self-explanatory 
-> "plasma_choice" : '1' gives the ratio of plasma to neutral gas, otherwise absolute plasama density is calculated. For the 
absolute plasma density to be calculated the gas density must be defined in line 67.
-> "only_take_data" : '1' will stop all data analyis. Otherwise full data anlysis is performed. This is useful for recording 
laser intensities quickly without the other data analysis.  
-> "remove_background" : '1' removes background pixels from intensity measurements. Removes premeasured camera background
intensities from the measured intensities. To use this function the background must be defined in the directory definintion 
section beggining at line 24. 
-> "calculate_plasma_density_ration" : self-explanatory
-> "center_images" : value of '1' will run the image allignement function. This can be used for alligning the images once measured
(example_setting 2) or from the live data taking (example_setting 0).
-> "calculate_real_intensity" : value of '1' will use the "intensity_from_energy_calc" routine to change the camera pixel values to
actual intensities using "real_time_energy" variable (defined on line 518) to do the conversion. User should redefine this energy
or change it so that this can be read from beam diagnostics on line 518.

###### OWIS/PICO MOTOR COMMANDS #####
OWIS
-> JDDD location: 'FLASH.DIAG/FFW.TUNNEL.FOCUS/MOTOR1'
-> setting position: 'FLASH.DIAG/FFW.TUNNEL.FOCUS/MOTOR1/POS.SET'
-> actual position: 'FLASH.DIAG/FFW.TUNNEL.FOCUS/MOTOR1/POS'
-> move command: CMD_1 = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFW.TUNNEL.FOCUS/MOTOR1/CMD',1)
-> stop command: CMD_2 = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFW.TUNNEL.FOCUS/MOTOR1/CMD',2)

PICO 1 (Reallignment - independent vertical and horizontal movement)
-> JDDD location: 'FLASH.DIAG/FFWD.PICO.5/PICO_DEVICE1'
VERTICAL
-> set relative position : pico_1_vert_set = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFWD.PICO.5/PICO_DEVICE1/PICOMOTOR.TARGET_POSITION1', set_position_vert)
-> move command :  pico_1_vert_move = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFWD.PICO.5/PICO_DEVICE1/PICOMOTOR.COMMAND1', 1)

HORIZONTAL
-> set relative position : pico_1_horz_set = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFWD.PICO.5/PICO_DEVICE1/PICOMOTOR.TARGET_POSITION2', set_position_horz)
-> move commnd : pico_1_horz_move = doocswrite('FLASH.DIAG/FFWD.PICO.5/PICO_DEVICE1/PICOMOTOR.COMMAND2', 1)

##### KNOWN ISSUES #####
-> Currently the post processing image allignment is not working as expected. Image moves opposite to what is expected.
-> Matlab crashes when combining more than five contour plots for the plasma density distrobution
-> The plasma density seems too large for the input values. 

##### Redundant code #####
-> "laser_intensity_scaling" This is now done by the "intensity_from_energy_calc" function. 
-> definintion of x/y coordinates on lines 106-112 and 116-124 as this is now done with real pixel dimensions.
